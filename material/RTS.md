RTS is a simple computer signal, its full name is "Request to Send". When we use computers and other devices to communicate, RTS helps them know when they can start sending data.

Imagine you and your friend play a game using a walkie-talkie, but you have to take turns talking. RTS is like a rule, telling the other party "It's my turn to speak now" so that you don't speak at the same time and let the other party listen to the salute. When one is ready to send data, it will use the RTS signal to tell the other device "I To start sending, please prepare to receive." This way, data can be transferred smoothly from one device to another.

Therefore, RTS is a little helper that helps computers and other devices communicate in an orderly manner!

**When IRTS is set to 1: This is like saying "we don't need this button, the device can know when to receive information".
Sometimes, we will set IRTS to 1 because it is simpler and the device can work more freely without us having to control when it can receive information. This is helpful when the device is busy, as it can manage when it receives messages itself, rather than waiting for us to press a button to tell it to start.**
